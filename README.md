# Who's on Call?


A small app asking PagerDuty who's on call an if that name changed since the last time it sends a text message using Twilio to the involved parties.

The plan is to use a [Heroku](http://heroku.com)-app to host this and use the scheduler add-on to run the script every morning or something in that fashion. We'll see how it progresses.

### Problem statement
We have a rolling schedule 

## Install
Draft:

* Push to heroku
    * 	```git push heroku master```
* enter config values
    *	```heroku config:set env..```   
* install heroku [scheduler add-on](https://addons.heroku.com/scheduler)
* configure schedule add on
 


## Pre-reqs
Pager duty account
Twilio account with some credits on it.

#### API KEY
**process.env.PD_APIKEY **

#### Subdomain
**PD_SUBDOMAIN**

### Twilio
