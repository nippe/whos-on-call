# Who's on Call?

##(IN PROGRESS....)

A small app asking PagerDuty who's on call an if that name changed since the last time it sends a text message using Twilio to the involved parties.

The plan is to use a [Heroku](http://heroku.com)-app to host this and use the scheduler add-on to run the script every morning or something in that fashion. We'll see how it progresses.

I wanted to store current user on call to compare with for changes. Using a non resilient hosting as heroku I found no other way than to keep that data external. I chose mongoDB becaues of ease. But it feels like major overkill to use mongo to store one lousy json document... But it works :).

### Problem statement
We have a rolling schedule in PagerDuty on my company. The thing is that I don't know if I'm on or off duty without checking in PagerDuty. So what this app does is to check for changes in who is on call and send a text message to both the user entering on call status and the one leaving.
